A simple sollaborative screenplay editing app, using Quill.js as the editor and Django/mysql for user-management and syncing.
NOT intended for production, this is just a hobby project for the use of my students. 
The "standalone" branch includes just the editor with the simple formatting styles, and no multiuser or collaborative features. It just saves locally.
